#Game/Idea/Large-Scope #Game/Roguelike #Game/Deckbuilder

### Option 1:
- Roguelike deck/city builder
- Buildings are cards, so building the city and the deck is the same thing

### Option 2:
- no turns, real time
- ccg instead of roguelike
- battlefield is 2 cities, one for each player
- mana system based on traffic flow
	- trucks deliver mana, so if traffic is bad mana rates are slow
	- same thing for card draw
- different themes
	- modern, sci fi, medieval, fantasy
	- entirely cosmetic as a form of alternate art that changes the 3d models too?
	- replacement for different characters/classes that have different playstyles (e.g. color in mtg, character in hearthstone)?

### Option 3:
- Roguelike traffic management deck builder
