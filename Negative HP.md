#Game/Idea/Large-Scope 

### Mechanics:
- Unique health system, need exactly 0 hp to die
- Having negative hp sends you to the underworld
- Positive hp sends you back to the living world
- Damage types that damage you in one world heal you in the other
	- Example: living world weapons cause hp value to go down, but to an undead that is healing because it takes them further from 0 into the negative values
### Story:
- Intro: executed in the living world, tricks hades/death to go back to life resulting in both worlds trying to kill the player
- Potential damage types being radiant/holy vs dark/unholy
