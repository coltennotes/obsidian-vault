#Game/Idea/Large-Scope #VR

- VR game
- spells are combos of button presses(eg. a a b a rt rt b)
- timing effects spell strength
- there can be pauses in the combos to make timing them correctly more difficult
- rythm game?

alternative option:
- different buttons have different effects
- short combos to create more interesting effects
- chain short combos to form spells
- example
	- A is add velocity, can be pressed multiple times to strengthen effect
	- followed by joystick for direction, curving joystick curves projectiles
	- in the other hand, create and hold a telekinesis spell to redirect the prpjectile as it flies
- customize spellbook to change what buttons have what effect equipped
