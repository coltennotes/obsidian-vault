#Game/Idea/Large-Scope #Procedural #AI 

- Nearly 100% procedurally generated game
- Enemies are procedurally generated
	- Phyical traits are randomized and used to generate a model and texture
	- Abilities/attacks randomized including patterns, aoe shapes and locations, damage types (ex. Random chance of each element  random chance of multiple elements, physical component a separate chance
- Deep learning artificial intelligence can create textures and models for creatures and environments
	- The ai can associate certain style with certain themes (ex. Cyberpunk + fantasy, clockwork + eldritch horror, fire/volcanic + toxic
- AI writes story (may be implausible, ai dungeon failed at this)

If single player with genshin style coop:
- Each region is procedurally generated and a region can be shared with other players

If server based like traditional mmos:
- As people explore the server regions are procedurally generated
- Each server is completely different
