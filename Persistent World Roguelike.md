#Game/Idea/Large-Scope #Game/Roguelike #Procedural

- Roguelike
- Procedural wold gen changes based on what the player is killed by
- Death doesnt necessarily mean losing character progression, but it always resets and changes the environment
- Enemies that kill you are upgraded to bosses and persist throughout runs until they are killed
